## System resources

!!! note "Syllabus points"
    - 6.1.1 Identify the resources that need to be managed within a computer system
    - 6.1.2 Evaluate the resources available in a variety of computer systems
    - 6.1.3 Identify the limitations of a range of resources in a specified computer system
    - 6.1.4 Describe the possible problems resulting from the limitations in the resources in a computer system

### Resources to manage

- Primary memory (RAM)
- Secondary storage/memory (HDD/SSD/optical drives)
- Processor speed
- Bandwidth
- Screen resolution
- Sound processor
- Graphics processor
- Cache
- Network connectivity

#### Primary memory

The primary memory is a place where all data/programs **currently being processed** are kept.

Too little physical memory means the system needs to use **secondary storage** via **virtual memory**, which is much slower; if virtual memory cannot be created or is insufficient, the program/data **cannot be loaded**. It influences how many processes can be done simultaneously.

#### Secondary storage

The secondary storage is a place where data/programs can be stored **even if power is lost** (RAM is volatile).

Too little storage space limits **how much data** can be kept. There would be no place to **save the work** so data might be **lost**. The OS cannot use storage as **virtual memory** if RAM fills up.

#### Processor

The processor does all calculations in a computer system.

The processor speed is a measurement of **how many calculations** can be done per second (1GHz = 1 billion calculations per second).

A core is an **ALU** (arithmetic logic unit) that can do calculations. A multi-core processor has multiple ALUs, so it can do more calculations at once.

Too slow a processor means it will **take longer** to perform tasks. Fewer cores mean the processor can only do a limited number of tasks at once (i.e. affects how many tasks a system can cope with **simultaneously**).

#### Bandwidth

Bandwidth is a measurement of how much data can be sent **at the same time** in a certain time frame (also called bitrate), measured in bits per second (bps).

Limiting the bandwidth means data will **take longer** to move between two points (i.e. affects how long it takes before data can be processed in its entirety).

#### Screen resolution

Screen resolution is a measurement of the **number of pixels** (the height times the width) of the display.

If the resolution is too **limited**, the number of pixels that can be displayed is **less**, so the display might be **pixelated** (blocky). Lower resolution means **smaller file size**, but **poorer quality** images.

#### Sound processor

**Sound reproduction** is done by a separate processor, freeing up the CPU to do **other calculations**. It can also contain a bank of **"sampled" sounds** to reproduce better-quality music/audio.

Without a sound processor, the CPU is taxed with processing sounds, **slowing down the system** overall. The **overall quality** is not as high as in a system with a dedicated sound processor.

#### Graphics Processor

A graphics processor does **complex graphic processing** (like 3D rendering).

If the CPU has to do graphics processing, it will **take longer or be limited**.

#### Cache

The cache contains the instruction/data the CPU is **likely to request next** from RAM. It **speeds up processing** as the CPU **does not have to "wait"** for instructions to arrive from RAM.

Without the cache, the CPU will have to wait for instructions/data to be fetched from RAM, **slowing down the system**. The user will experience a **"sluggish" system**.

#### Network interface controller (NIC)

Each network card **connects** to a particular type of **network media** (cable/wireless signal).

Types of NIC:

- NIC: LAN/ethernet cables
- WNIC (Wireless NIC): WiFi signals
- Bluetooth: Bluetooth signals
- 3G radio: cellular signals

Limited connection types **limit the way** data can be sent or received in a system. **Speed** can also be a factor.

### Resources in different computer systems

#### Mainframe

- Processor: **thousands** of cores
- Primary memory: vast amounts (to support **multiple simultaneous clients**)
- Secondary storage: vast amounts (lots of **backup storage**)
- Common use
    - Large companies
    - For weather/financial predictions
    - To "virtualize" smaller computers

    - Portability and battery life are key features

#### Cell phones/mobiles

- Processor: Single/Multicore
- Primary memory: 1-3 GB
- Secondary memory: Usually limited, but can be upgraded (MicroSD card)
- Common use
    - The most common personal computing device in the world
    - Getting more capable, rivaling PCs/laptops
    - The biggest constraint is screen size and input options (lack of physical keyboard)

- Common use
    - Very common for media consumption
    - Getting more capable, rivaling PCs/laptops
    - The biggest constraint is the lack of a physical keyboard

#### PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants)

- Secondary memory: Expandable through the use of memory cards (SD/Compact flash/Memory Stick)
- Common use
    - For higher-end photography
    - Most digital cameras are now integrated into mobile phones/laptops/tablets

### Limitations of resources

- Primary memory: too little → virtual memory (slower), or else not be able to process instructions
- Secondary storage: too little → not able to store data and for virtual memory
- CPU: too slow → latency, lag, or failure (cascading failure: one process not being able to execute instructions may impact another process)
- Network: limited bandwidth → slow transfer of data (latency/lag)
- Display server: insufficient resources → slow display of graphics (lag), corrupted/failure to display graphics
- Sound server: insufficient resources → slow playback of sound (lag), corrupted/failure to play sound

IB syllabus examples:

- User time is wasted if primary memory is too small or processor speed inadequate
- Multi-access and multi-programming environments should be considered as well as single-user systems
    - Multi-user system: many users on the same machine/many users connected to the same network
    - Multi-programming system: a system that can have different programs (apps) installed (v.s. single programming system - can only run one program/set of programs, e.g. car navigation system)

## Role of the operating system

!!! note "Syllabus points"
    - 6.1.5 Explain the role of the operating system in terms of managing memory, peripherals, and hardware interfaces
    - 6.1.7 Outline OS resource management techniques: scheduling, policies, multitasking, virtual memory, paging, interrupt, polling
    - 6.1.8 Discuss the advantages of producing a dedicated operating system for a device
    - 6.1.9 Outline how an operating system hides the complexity of the hardware from users and applications

### Functions of the operating system

!!! note "See also"
    [SLHL03b OS & Applications § System software](../SLHL/03b.md#system-software)

- Controlling peripheral devices: through drivers (software that allows the OS to communicate with the hardware), allows users to use the peripheral devices through other software
- Managing primary memory: ensure that each process (program) runs in its own allocated memory space to prevent corruption of data/security issues
- [Virtual memory](#virtual-memory-and-paging): temporarily transfer pages of data from RAM to disk storage to compensate for shortages of physical memory
- Managing secondary storage: provide folder/directory structure and access methods, including security access
- User interface: provide a way for users to interact with the computer system

### OS resource management techniques

#### Time-slicing/scheduling

- Multi-user system: the set amount of processing time each user gets
- Single-user system: the set amount of processing time each program gets
- Slices/threads are alternately processed to give the illusion of "multitasking"
- Scheduling: the method used to determine which work gets to use resources next (e.g. processors, network links, expansion cards)
    - Round-robin: each process gets a fixed amount of time to execute (e.g. process A gets 10ms, process B gets 10ms, process C gets 10ms, then back to process A)

![Time-slicing](https://i.imgur.com/1s8gHq3.png)

#### Interrupt

- Interrupts: signals sent to the CPU by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention
- Handled by the interrupt handler (part of the OS) based on the priority of the interrupt
- Upon receiving an interrupt, the OS will suspend the current process, save its state and execute the interrupt handler; after the interrupt handler is finished, the OS will restore the state of the process and resume it
- Can be hardware or software generated (e.g. divide by zero error in a program, or a key press on the keyboard)

#### Policies

- Policies: rules that determine what needs to be done when a certain event occurs
- Mechanisms: rules that specify how to do something
- e.g. the timer construct that limits the amount of time a process can run is a mechanism; the amount of time that each process gets is a (user) policy

#### Multitasking

- Multitasking: the ability of an OS to execute more than one process at the same time
- The OS keeps track of all the processes that are running and allocates CPU time to each process

#### Virtual memory and paging

- Virtual memory: a feature of the OS that allows a computer to compensate for shortages of physical memory by temporarily transferring pages of data from RAM to disk storage
- Paging/swapping: the process of transferring pages of data from RAM to disk storage and back
- Pagefile/swap file: the temporary storage space on the hard disk that stores the pages of data
- Memory Management Unit (MMU): the hardware that manages the paging process
- Algorithms used by the MMU to determine which pages to swap out:
    - Least recently used (LRU): the page that has not been used for the longest time
    - First in first out (FIFO): the page that has been in memory for the longest time
    - Least frequently used (LFU): the page that has been used the least number of times
    - Random: a random page is selected
- Advantage: allows more applications to run than there is available physical memory by the use of page/swap files/part of hard disk as primary memory; larger application can run with less real RAM
- Disadvantage: applications run more slowly and it takes more time to switch between applications, as it uses hard drive memory as primary memory; when a computer's virtual memory resources are overused, programs lock-up/do not run/disk thrashing occurs; reduce the amount of hard drive space available for storage

#### Polling

- Polling: the process where the computer or controlling device waits for an external device to check for its readiness or state, often with low-level hardware (e.g. when a printer is connected via a parallel port,
the computer waits until the printer has received the next
character)
- Alternatives to polling: interrupts (signals generated by devices or processes to indicate that they need attention)
- Polling v.s. interrupt (advantages and disadvantages)
    - Polling
        - Advantages
            - Simple to implement
            - No need for additional hardware
        - Disadvantages
            - Wastes CPU time
            - Can miss events if the polling interval is too long
    - Interrupt
        - Advantages
            - Does not waste CPU time
            - Does not miss events
        - Disadvantages
            - Requires additional hardware
            - More complex to implement

### Dedicated OS

Examples of dedicated OS:

- iOS/macOS/iPadOS for Apple products only
- Embedded OS: OS that is built into the device (e.g. car navigation system, smart TV)
- Real-time OS: OS that is designed to process data as it comes in (e.g. air traffic control system, stock market system)

Advantages of dedicated OS:

- **Security**: e.g. banks use dedicated OS to prevent cyber attacks
- **Customisability**: can perform a specific function at maximum efficiency
- **Modify priorities**: can eliminate unnecessary features to reduce OS size and resource usage

### Hiding complexity

- **Abstraction** of the OS hides the complexity of the **hardware** from users and applications
- Different hardware media can appear **the same** to the user (e.g. USB flash drive, external hard drive, SD card, CD/DVD)

Examples:

- **Drive letter**: a letter assigned to a storage device by the OS (e.g. C: drive, D: drive)
- **Virtual memory**: the user sees a section of the hard disk as if it were RAM, and the OS manages the paging process
- **Input devices**: the OS takes care of the low-level details of the peripheral devices (e.g. keyboard, mouse, touchpad, touchscreen, microphone, camera, etc.)
- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: a virtual machine that allows Java programs to run on any platform by interpreting the Java **bytecode** for a particular **hardware platform**
