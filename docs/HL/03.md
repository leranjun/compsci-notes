# 03 Abstract Data Structures

## Recursion

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - D.4.1 Define the term recursion
    - 5.1.1 Identify a situation that requires the use of recursive thinking
    - 5.1.2 Identify recursive thinking in a specified problem solution

Recursion is the technique of **calling (a simpler version of) a function within itself**. Recursions need a **base case** (**ending condition**). It is useful for a large task that can be **broken down into repetitive sub-tasks**.

```java
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}
```

### Advantages

- Simpler code (only need to define the **base case** and **recursive case**)
- Some problems are **inherently recursive**, such as Graph and Tree Traversal
- Reduces the **length of the code** compared to iterative code

### Disadvantages

- Generally **slower** than non-recursive functions (because each time the function is called, the stack grows and the final answer is returned when the stack is popped completely)
- May require a lot of **memory space** to hold intermediate results on the system stacks; may run out of memory if recursive calls are not properly checked
- Hard to **analyse or understand** the code

## Stack

    - 5.1.10 Explain the use of arrays as static stacks and queues

A stack is a data structure which operates on a first-in, last-out basis (**LIFO**). It uses a single pointer (**index**) to keep track of the data.

```ascii
+---+
| 3 | <-- top
+---+
| 2 |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+
```

The basic operations associated with a stack are:

- insert (**push**) an item onto the stack
- remove (**pop**) an item from the stack

### Push

```java
void push(int item) {
    if (top == MAX - 1) {
        System.out.println("Stack is full");
    } else {
        stack[++top] = item;
    }
}
```

### Pop

```java
int pop() {
    if (top == -1) {
        System.out.println("Stack is empty");
        return -1;
    } else {
        return stack[top--];
    }
}
```

## Queue

    - 5.1.10 Explain the use of arrays as static stacks and queues

A queue is a data structure which operates on a first-in, first-out basis (**FIFO**). It uses **2 pointers** to keep track of the **HEAD** and the **TAIL** of the queue.

```ascii
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
  ^                                   ^
  |                                   |
 head                                tail
```

The basic operations associated with a queue are:

- insert (enqueue) an item into the queue
- remove (dequeue) an item from the queue
