# 03.1 Recursive Thinking

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 5.1.1 Identify a situation that requires the use of recursive thinking
    - 5.1.2 Identify recursive thinking in a specified problem solution
    - D.4.1 Define the term recursion

Recursion is the technique of **calling (a simpler version of) a function within itself**. Recursions need a **base case (ending condition**). It is useful for a large task that can be **broken down into repetitive sub-tasks**.

```java
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

- Advantages
    - Simpler code (only need to define the **base case** and **recursive case**)
    - Some problems are **inherently recursive**, such as graph and tree traversal
    - Reduces the **length of the code** compared to iterative code
- Disadvantages
    - Generally **slower** than non-recursive functions (because each time the function is called, the stack grows and the final answer is returned when the stack is popped completely)
    - May require a lot of **memory space** to hold intermediate results on the system stacks; may **run out of memory** if recursive calls are not properly checked
    - Hard to **analyse or understand** the code
