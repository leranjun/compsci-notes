# Part 2: ADT Stack

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 5.1.10 Explain the use of arrays as static stacks and queues
    - D.4.14 Outline the features of ADT's stack, queue and binary tree

A stack is a data structure which operates on a first-in, last-out basis (**LIFO**). It uses a single pointer (**index**) to keep track of the data.

```ascii
+---+
| 3 | <-- top
+---+
| 2 |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+ 
```

## Features

- Made of a "chain" of data
- Elements can be "pushed" onto the top
- Elements can be "popped" from the top
- LIFO (last-in, first-out)
- Accessing an element from an empty stack is an error

Basic operations:

- insert (**push**) an item onto the stack
- remove (**pop**) an item from the stack

## Applications

- Function calls (call stack): stores the return address of the function
- Expression evaluation and syntax parsing: stores the operators and operands (infix, postfix, prefix)
- Parenthesis matching: stores the opening parenthesis and pops them when a matching closing parenthesis is encountered
- String reversal: stores the characters of the string

## Push

```java
void push(int item) {
    if (top + 1 == MAX) {
        System.out.println("Stack is full");
        return;
    }
    stack[++top] = item;
}
```

## Pop

```java
int pop() {
    if (top == -1) {
        System.out.println("Stack is empty");
        return -1;
    }
    return stack[top--];
}
```
