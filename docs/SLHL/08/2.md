# 08.2 Data Transmission

## Protocols and data packets

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 3.1.6 Define the terms: protocol, data packet
    - 3.1.7 Explain why protocols are necessary

- Protocol: a set of **rules/guidelines** that help with **interaction** between individuals or devices
- Network protocol: an **agreed-upon collection of rules** that servers, computers and other devices must follow for the transmissions to be successful (e.g. how the data is to be **formatted and packaged**, whether or not **data compression** is allowed)
- Standards vs protocols
    - Standards: **agreements** made by people/organisations to allow a **consistent approach** by **manufacturers or programmers** (e.g. HTML)
    - Protocols: sets of **rules** (designed by people) to allow different **devices** to **communicate** effectively (e.g. HTTP)
    - Standards are about **things** while protocols are about **processes**
- Data packets: a **unit of data** that is **routed** between an **origin** and a **destination** on a network
    - Composed of **overheads** (e.g. a **header**) and a **payload** (the actual data)
    - Overhead includes **source** and **destination** addresses, the **order** of the packet, **error-checking** information, etc.

### Necessity of protocols

- Provide **standard** ways of communicating and interacting (ensure **compatibility**)
- Data integrity: ensure the overall **completeness**, **accuracy** and **consistency** of data
    - Error checking: detect **noise** or other **impairments** introduced into data while it is transmitted from source to destination
- Flow control (**speed** of transmission): prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver
- Deadlock prevention: when two nodes or processes are trying to access **the same node at the same moment**, causing neither to be able to proceed
- Congestion: when a node or link carries so much data that it may **deteriorate network service quality**, resulting in queuing delay, frame or data packet loss and the blocking of new connections

## Speed of data transmission

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 3.1.8 Explain why the speed of data transmission across a network can vary

- Constantly changing factors
    - Number of people (**traffic**)
    - **Concentration/geographic distribution** of traffic
    - **Kind** of activity (e.g. Netflix vs email - bigger files and more simultaneous connections)
    - **Interference/noise** resulting in packets getting lost and needing to be resent
- Non-changing factors (software/hardware)
    - Transmitting server and receiving client hardware (e.g. CPU, amount of RAM, speed of routers/switches/network cards)
    - Transmission media (e.g. fibre optic cables, copper cables, wireless)
    - Protocol: compression, speed (allowed by the protocol), congestion, security
    - ISP: geographical distance, kind of transmission service, maximum speed

## Data compression

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 3.1.9 Explain why compression of data is often necessary when transmitting across a network

- Compression: the process of **reducing the size** of a file by removing unnecessary data
- User-level compression: **lossless** (e.g. ZIP, PNG, GIF) or **lossy** (e.g. JPEG, MP3, MP4)
- Network-level compression: reduces the size of data frames to be transmitted over a network link to **reduce the bandwidth** required, prevent **congestion**, and **increase the speed** of transmission

## Transmission media

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 3.1.10 Outline the characteristics of different transmission media

| Speed                           | Reliability        | Cost                | Security            |        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
| Metal - Twisted Pair (Ethernet) | 100 Mbps - 10 Gbps | Good                | Low                 | Good   |
| Metal - Coaxial                 | Slow - 10 Mbps     | Better              | Low                 | Better |
| Fiber Optic                     | Up to 100 Gbps     | Best                | High (incl. set-up) | Best   |
| Wireless                        | 100 Mbps max.      | Not too bad, but... | Not too bad         | Issues |

## Packet switching

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 3.1.11 Explain how data is transmitted by packet switching

- Packet switching: breaking a message into **packets** that are **routed** individually to the destination, where they are **reassembled** into the original message
- Steps of packet switching
    1. A file is **broken up** into packets of a **fixed length** and each packet is transmitted **separately**
    2. Each packet includes a **packet number**
    3. Packets are **assembled** and **reordered** at the destination
    4. Each packet has a **counter** which **decrements** as it passes through a node; after a certain number of hops, it is assumed the packet is **lost** and the packet is **trashed**
    5. Packet errors can occur as a result of **collisions or interference**; **retransmission** is requested in these cases
    6. Packet switching is suitable when **small delays** can be tolerated (i.e. email transmission), or the complete transmission **doesn't have to happen together**
- Advantages
    - The transmission will not be **broken** if any one link is broken (can be routed through another link)
    - Avoids congestion: more than one route can be used; faster overall network
    - **Cheaper** for individuals: no need for dedicated lines
