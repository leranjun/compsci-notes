## Hardware and software components

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 3.1.13 Describe the hardware and software components of a wireless network

### Hardware

- Transmitting device
    - Wireless Access Point (AP)/Router: receives the Internet signal via a **cable** (e.g. Ethernet), then **broadcasts** the wireless signal, allowing **multiple devices** to connect to the Internet
    - Wireless **antenna**: built into the wireless AP/router; sends radio wave transmissions on **specific frequencies** to receivers on other devices; significantly increases the communication **range** of the wireless radio signal
- Receiving device
    - Wireless **antenna**: could be a short antenna or simply a wire
    - **Network Interface Card (NIC)** and receiver: receives the radio waves and **translates** them into **digital signals**

### Software

- **Wireless drivers**: software that allows the OS to **communicate** with the **wireless hardware**
- **Wireless protocols** (e.g. 802.11a, 802.11b, c, 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax)
- **Network utilities** provided by the OS

## Characteristics of wireless networks

    - 3.1.14 Describe the characteristics of wireless networks

### Types of wireless networks

- Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)
    - Also called **Wireless LAN** (WLAN): supplied via **LAN**
    - Allows relatively slow to fast data transmissions (depending on the standard) - up to **1.3Gbps** (802.11ac), but usually **54Mbps** (802.11g)
    - **Backward compatible** with older standards
    - **Small transmitting radius**: suitable for **homes** (32m indoors)
- WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access)
    - **Lower speed** than Wi-Fi and 3G (up to 40Mbps)
    - **Line of sight** required between transmitter and receiver
    - **Large transmitting radius**: designed for **developing countries**, suitable for **cities** (50km)
    - Rivaled by **Long Term Evolution (LTE)**
- 3G (3rd Generation Mobile Communication Technology)
    - **Lower speed** (up to 15Mbps)
    - For **mobile devices** (phones, tablets, etc.)
    - Able to switch between technologies (2G, 3G, 4G)
- 4G (4th Generation Mobile Communication Technology)
    - **Higher speed** (up to 100Mbps)
- 5G (5th Generation Mobile Communication Technology)
    - **Higher speed** (up to 900Mbps)
    - **Lower range** (requires more **transmitters**)
    - Has issues with penetration through **walls**

## Methods of network security

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 3.1.15 Describe the different methods of network security
    - 3.1.16 Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each method of network security

Factors of security:

- **Confidentiality**
- **Integrity** (maintaining accuracy of data)
- **Availability** (e.g. DoS attacks)

Methods of security:

- Authentication: is the user who they say they are?
    - One-factor authentication: **password** (something you **know**)
    - Two-factor authentication: **password + token** (something you **have**)
    - Three-factor authentication: **password + token + biometric** (something you **are**)
- Encryption: **scrambling** data so that only the intended recipient can read it (symmetric or asymmetric)
    - Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP): **weak** encryption, easily hacked, superseded by WPA in 2003
    - Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA): **strong** encryption, uses Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)
    - WPA2: **stronger** encryption, uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), instructions can only come from someone who **already has access the network**
- Firewall: a **barrier** between a trusted network and an untrusted network
    - Hardware, software, hybrid
    - Controls **incoming** and **outgoing** network traffic
    - Analyse data packets based on **determined** security rules
- Media Access Control (MAC) filtering
    - Hard-coded **unique** identifier for each network device (managed by IEEE)
    - Used to **identify** specific pieces of hardware
    - MAC can be **spoofed**
- Physical security: locked doors, security guards, etc.

Advantages and disadvantages:

- Authentication
    - Advantages
        - **Software** solution (no extra **cost**)
        - Access rights can be set for **individual users**
        - User groups can be created to **simplify** access rights
    - Disadvantages
        - A user's credentials can be **stolen** (e.g. **brute force** attack)
        - Does not protect against **eavesdropping** (intercepting messages in a network)
- Encryption
    - Advantages
        - Difficult to **crack** (especially AES)
        - **Software** solution (no extra **cost**)
    - Disadvantages
        - **Performance** overhead (slower data transfer)
        - **Vulnerability** will be discovered eventually and may be exploited if not updated
        - Can be prone to hacking if **weak** or **inconsistently** implemented (e.g. WEP)
- Firewall
    - Advantages
        - User-level firewalls are often **free** (incorporated into OS)
        - Easy to **implement** when intended for personal use
        - Expert firewalls are **difficult** to bypass
    - Disadvantages
        - **Performance** overhead (slower data transfer)
        - User-level firewalls can be **breached** by malware
        - Expert firewalls are **expensive** and require **expertise** to maintain
