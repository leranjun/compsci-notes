# 08.1 Network Fundamentals

## Types of networks

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 3.1.1 Identify different types of networks

Network: a **group of computer systems** and other computing hardware devices that are **linked together** through **communication channels** to facilitate **communication and resource-sharing** among a range of users.

### Local Area Network (LAN)

- Covers a **small geographical area** (e.g. a single building)
- Mostly based on **Ethernet** technology

#### Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)

- A **logical** group of workstations, servers and network devices that appear to be on the same LAN despite their geographical distribution (as opposed to a **physical** LAN)
- Allows a network of computers and users to communicate in a **simulated environment** as if they exist in a single LAN
- e.g. separating a network into different departments/access levels, multi-player games in a gaming cafe

#### Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)

- A **wireless** distribution method for two or more devices that use **high-frequency radio waves** and often include an access point to the Internet
- Allows users to **move around** the coverage area while maintaining a network connection

### Wide Area Network (WAN)

- More than one LAN connected across **wider geographic locations** (e.g. different buildings in a city)

### Storage Area Network (SAN)

- A **dedicated high-speed network** that provides access to **block-level storage**
- Makes a network of storage devices accessible to multiple servers (appear to servers as attached drives)

### Internet

- A **globally connected** network system that uses the **TCP/IP protocol** to transmit data via various types of media
- A network of **global exchanges** connected by wired, wireless and fibre-optic technologies

### Intranet and extranet

- Intranet: a **local/restricted/private** network that provides an **internal** network for an organisation (e.g. an employee announcement board)
- Extranet: an Intranet that can be partially accessed by **authorised users outside the organisation** (e.g. suppliers, vendors, partners, customers)

### Virtual Private Network (VPN)

- A group of computers connected through **encrypted lines**, either within another LAN or around the world, using the **Internet**
- Allows people to log into a network **remotely** and access its resources, but **encrypts** the connection to prevent eavesdropping

### Personal Area Network (PAN)

- A computer network used for **data transmission** among devices such as computers, telephones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) that are **close to one person** (**very small area**)
- Can be created using e.g. Bluetooth, infrared, USB

### Peer-to-peer (P2P)

- A **network model** in which computers or hardware devices **directly** exchange files **without needing a hub/server** to direct and manage the traffic
- "Equal client" system

## Importance of standards

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 3.1.2 Outline the importance of standards in the construction of networks

- So parts can fit together and work together
    - All Ethernet cables fit into all hubs and switches etc.
- So users can expect certain levels of performance etc.
    - A CAT-5 Ethernet cable allows data transfer at a certain bandwidth
- So interacting parts do not interfere with each other
    - Different WiFi networks do not interfere with each other
- So equipment is safe, with electrical output etc.
    - A modem will not overheat when plugged into either 110 Volt or 220 Volt sockets

- Provides **common ground** for manufacturers of networking products on which to build their systems
- Interconnects products from **various vendors**
- Facilitates **communication** between devices

## Layers of a network

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 3.1.3 Describe how communication over networks is broken down into different layers

Mnemonic:

- (bottom-up) People Don't Need Those Stupid Packets Anyway
- (top-down) All People Seem To Need Data Processing

| Layer | Name         | Description                                                                                                                                     | Example                |
| ----- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 7     | Application  | Provides the ability for **user applications** to interact with the network                                                                     | HTTP, FTP, SMTP        |
| 6     | Presentation | Preparation of appropriate **data representation**, **encryption/decryption** and **compression/decompression**                                 | ASCII, JPEG, MPEG, SSL |
| 5     | Session      | Provides **session management** between applications                                                                                            | NetBIOS, PPTP, RPC     |
| 4     | Transport    | Provides **reliable** and **sequential** packet delivery through **error correction** and **flow control**                                      | TCP, UDP               |
| 3     | Network      | Provides **logical addressing** and **routing** of packets across networks (determination of the **path** through the network the data will go) | IP, ICMP, ARP          |
| 2     | Data Link    | Provides **physical addressing** and **error detection** for packets                                                                            | Ethernet, PPP, ATM     |
| 1     | Physical     | Provides **physical topology** and **electrical** or **optical** signalling                                                                     | Cables, connectors     |

### Networking protocols

!!! note "See also"
    [SL08.2 Data Transmission ยง Protocols and data packets](2.md#protocols-and-data-packets)

- TCP/IP: the **standard** protocol for the Internet; a **packet-switching** protocol that resides in the Network and Transport layers of the OSI model
- UDP: a **connectionless** protocol that **does not guarantee** the delivery of packets
- IP address: a **unique** address that **identifies** a device on the Internet or a local network

## VPN technologies

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 3.1.4 Identify the technologies required to provide a VPN
    - 3.1.5 Evaluate the use of a VPN

### VPN hardware

- Network Access Server: an access point to the Internet at both ends of the connection (e.g. router, gateway server)
- VPN Tunneling Server (PPTP server): allows PPTP tunnelling through the Internet

### VPN software

- Tunnelling: establishing and maintaining a **logical network connection** to transmit **specially formatted data packets**, which are **encapsulated** within some other protocol and will be **de-encapsulated** on the receiving side
- Encryption: **encoding** data so that only a computer with the **right decoder** will be able to read and use it

### VPN protocols

- Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP): one of the **most common** protocols used for controlling VPN sessions; developed by Microsoft and can be used by Windows machines
- Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP): more **secure**; uses UDP; encrypts data using a strong 256-bit encryption system (so **slower** and takes more **CPU power**); created by Cisco and Microsoft
- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): can be used with a standard web browser (not Windows-specific); does not require **specialised servers**

### Use of VPN

- Businesses/organisations
    - Advantages
        - Security: employees can process sensitive data securely from a remote site; preventing industrial espionage
        - Remote work: allows people to **work at home**
        - Cost savings: less expensive than building a **physical WAN**; cost savings on **office space** and **travel** if employees work from home
    - Disadvantages
        - Distractions: employees may be **distracted** when working from a remote environment (e.g. home chores, family) and **less productive**
        - Less person-to-person contact: **decreased efficiency** for group projects and more **interpersonal issues**
- Individuals
    - Advantages
        - Stay-at-home parents: can **work from home** while taking care of children
        - More healthy **work environment**: can take a break when needed
        - Security: e-commerce transactions are **encrypted**
    - Disadvantages
        - Anti-social: **less social interaction** with colleagues
        - Illegal uses of VPN (e.g. hacking, piracy, illegal downloading)
