# 01 Computational Thinking

!!! summary
    1. [Decomposition](#decomposition): break the problem down into its **components** & identify **subproblems** that need to be solved
    2. [Pattern recognition](#pattern-recognition): recognise **patterns** between subproblems
    3. [Abstraction/pattern generalisation](#abstraction): set up **operations** that can be used for the subproblems
    4. [Algorithm design](#algorithm-design): solve **parallel & sequential** subproblems

## Decomposition

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 4.1.1 Identify the procedure appropriate to solving a problem
    - 4.1.3 Explain the role of sub-procedures in solving a problem

- **Breaking down** a complex problem/system â†’ smaller, more manageable, easier-to-understand parts
- Then examine/solve/design individually
- "Divide and conquer"

### Benefits of decomposition

- Simpler to work with, easier to solve
    - Deal with one at a time only
    - Can straightforwardly understand each part before understanding the whole problem
- Different people can work on different parts at the same time
    - Reduce development time
- Components can be reused in other programs

### Examples of decomposition

![Decomposition example](https://i.imgur.com/3aWJqDU.jpg)

- Brushing teeth
    - which toothbrush to use
    - how long to brush for
    - how hard to press on our teeth
    - what toothpaste to use
- Solving crime
    - what crime was committed
    - when the crime was committed
    - where the crime was committed
    - what evidence there is
    - if there were any witnesses
    - if there have recently been any similar crimes
- Creating app
    - what kind of app do you want to create
    - what your app will look like
    - who is the target audience for your app
    - what your graphics will look like
    - what audio you will include
    - what software you will use to build your app
    - how the user will navigate your app
    - how you will test your app
    - where you will sell your app

## Pattern recognition

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 4.1.8 Deduce logical rules for real-world situations

Finding **patterns** (similarity/common characteristics) among small, decomposed problems.

### Benefits of pattern recognition

- Use the same problem-solving solution for the same pattern
    - Easier & quicker
    - Solve more complex problems more efficiently
- Solve the problem correctly (because generalisations have been identified)

### Examples of pattern recognition

There might even be patterns within a problem, e.g. for each ingredient, we need its name and a specific measurement.

## Abstraction

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 4.1.17 Identify examples of abstraction
    - 4.1.18 Explain why abstraction is required in the derivation of computational solutions for a specified situation
    - 4.1.19 Construct an abstraction from a specified situation
    - 4.1.20 Distinguish between a real-world entity and its abstraction

- **Filtering out/ignoring/taking away** unnecessary characteristics/details to concentrate on **necessary/essential** ones
- Creating a **model** (an easier-to-understand version/general idea of a complex system)

!!! tip
    A single abstraction can represent a whole class of similar things (e.g. for any bus route, we need the bus number, start/end time and bus stops to get on/off).

This can be done through successive [decomposition](#decomposition) and by keeping **general patterns** and removing **specific details**.

### Benefits of abstraction

- Can be viewed both as a process and as an entity (???)
- Enables concentration on essential aspects -> ignore distracting details
    - Focus on the right solution to a problem
- Technique for managing **complexity**

### Examples of abstraction

![Abstract-o-meter](https://i.imgur.com/jXeQGJg.png)

An MRT map is an abstraction of the geographically accurate map, but it contains enough information for us to navigate the MRT system.

In computer programming this can be:

## Algorithm Design

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 4.2.3 Discuss an algorithm to solve a specific problem

- A **plan** or a set of **step-by-step instructions** to solve a problem
    - Each instruction is identified
    - The order in which they should be carried out is planned
- A starting point for computer programs
- Represented using **pseudocode** or **flowchart**

### Examples of algorithm design

In GCSE-style pseudocode:

```pseudo
OUTPUT "What is your name?"
INPUT name
OUTPUT "Hello", name
OUTPUT "How old are you?"
INPUT age
IF age >= 70 THEN
    OUTPUT "You are aged to perfection!"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "You are a spring chicken!"
```
