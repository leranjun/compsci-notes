# 01 Computational Thinking

!!! summary
    1. [Decomposition](#decomposition): break the problem down into its **components** & identify **subproblems** that need to be solved
    2. [Pattern recognition](#pattern-recognition): recognise **patterns** between subproblems
    3. [Abstraction/pattern generalisation](#abstraction): set up **operations** that can be used for the subproblems
    4. [Algorithm design](#algorithm-design): solve **parallel & sequential** subproblems

## Decomposition

- **Breaking down** a complex problem/system -> smaller, more manageable, easierâ€“to-understand parts
- Then examine/solve/design individually
- "Divide and conquer"

### Benefits of decomposition

- Simpler to work with, easier to solve
    - Deal with one at a time only
    - Can straightforwardly understand each part before understanding the whole problem
- Different people can work on different parts at the same time
    - Reduce development time
- Components can be reused in other programs

### Examples of decomposition

![Decomposition example](https://i.imgur.com/3aWJqDU.jpg)

- Brushing teeth
    - which toothbrush to use
    - how long to brush for
    - how hard to press on our teeth
    - what toothpaste to use
- Solving crime
    - what crime was committed
    - when the crime was committed
    - where the crime was committed
    - what evidence there is
    - if there were any witnesses
    - if there have recently been any similar crimes
- Creating app
    - what kind of app do you want to create
    - what your app will look like
    - who is the target audience for your app
    - what your graphics will look like
    - what audio you will include
    - what software you will use to build your app
    - how the user will navigate your app
    - how you will test your app
    - where you will sell your app

## Pattern recognition

Finding **patterns** (similarity/common characteristics) among small, decomposed problems.

### Benefits of pattern recognition

- Use the same problem-solving solution for the same pattern
    - Easier & quicker
    - Solve more complex problems more efficiently
- Solve the problem correctly (because generalisations have been identified)

### Examples of pattern recognition

There might even be patterns within a problem, e.g. for each ingredient, we need its name and a specific measurement.

## Abstraction

- **Filtering out/ignoring/taking away** unnecessary characteristics/details to concentrate on **necessary/essential** ones
- Creating a **model** (an easier-to-understand version/general idea of a complex system)

!!! tip
    A single abstraction can represent a whole class of similar things (e.g. for any bus route, we need the bus number, start/end time and bus stops to get on/off).

This can be done through successive [decomposition](#decomposition) and by keeping **general patterns** and removing **specific details**.

### Benefits of abstraction

- Can be viewed both as a process and as an entity (???)
- Enables concentration on essential aspects -> ignore distracting details
    - Focus on the right solution to a problem
- Technique for managing **complexity**

### Examples of abstraction

An MRT map is an abstraction of the geographically accurate map, but it contains enough information for us to navigate the MRT system.

In computer programming this can be:

## Algorithm Design

- A **plan** or a set of **step-by-step instructions** to solve a problem
    - Each instruction is identified
    - The order in which they should be carried out is planned
- A starting point for computer programs
- Represented using **pseudocode** or **flowchart**

### Examples of algorithm design

In GCSE-style pseudocode:

```pseudocode
OUTPUT "What is your name?"
INPUT name
OUTPUT "Hello", name
OUTPUT "How old are you?"
INPUT age
IF age >= 70 THEN
    OUTPUT "You are aged to perfection!"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "You are a spring chicken!"
```
