# 03c Number Systems & Data Representation

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 2.1.9 Define the terms: bit, byte, binary, denary/decimal, hexadecimal
    - 2.1.10 Outline the way in which data is represented in the computer

## Applications of Number Systems

Hexadecimal: easier to convert **to and from binary** than decimal and easier to work with than binary in terms of **remembering, accuracy and checking**.

### Machine code

- Consists of only 1s and 0s (binary)
- Different for different groups of processors
- Sometimes able to enter the hexadecimal equivalent - faster and more accurate

### Assembly language

- Same structure as machine code
- Mnemonics instead of binary numbers
- 1-1 machine code conversion

### Media Access Control (MAC addresses)

- The physical address of a Network Interface Card (NIC)
- Used to uniquely identify a computer when connecting to a network
- Put on to the NIC by the manufacturer when the device is made
    - Cannot be changed
    - Different to an IP address (given to a device on a network by the network itself and can change)
- 6 groups of 2 hexadecimal digits (e.g. `00:3E:E1:C4:5D:DF`)
    - 2 hex digits/byte → 6 bytes/address

Hex MAC address > decimal because

- Converts to the binary equivalent digit-by-digit (no need to do the whole number at once)
- 12 digits can store $2^48 = 281,474,976,710,656$ different combinations

### HTML colours

- HTML is a markup language used to create web pages
- RGB colour mode: the amount of R, G, B divided into 256 levels → described by 2 hex digits; each colour → three pairs of hex numbers ranging from 0 to F

### Registers and values

- Registers can hold a certain number of bits of binary → can work out what values should be held/are already held
