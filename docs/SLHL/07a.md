## Planning and System Installation

### System planning and change management

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.1.1 Identify the context for which a new system is planned
    - 1.1.2 Describe the need for change management

- The **context** of a system is important in its planning (background, environment, framework, setting, or situation surrounding a system)
    - Considerations for context: **extent** and **limitations** of the new system
    - What **existing infrastructure** from the existing system can be used?
    - What requirements on **hardware and software** will the new system have?
    - Are there any **ethical issues** resulting (e.g. will the new system make people unnecessary, leading to loss of jobs)?
- Changing a system can be difficult
    - Users **don't like** change (too often/at all)
    - New systems might **omit old features**
    - Old systems might be **faster** in certain circumstances
    - People find change **complex**
    - From a technology perspective, change might lead to **incompatibility**
    - There might be **data loss** during migration
    - It might be **expensive** (either in terms of money or time)
- Change must be managed
    - Plan: a clear and valid **reason** and **mission** for the change process
    - Communicate: communicate the change, and its many factors, to **key stakeholders** within the organisation
    - Integrate: open up plans for **consultation** with your stakeholder group
    - Evaluate: monitor the **reactions** of the wider organisation to that change program

### Legacy systems and mergers

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.1.3 Outline compatibility issues resulting from situations including legacy systems or business mergers

- Legacy system: an **old** method, technology, computer system, or application program, that may or may **not be supported/available** for purchase any more
- Merger: a **combination** of two entities or more, especially companies, into one
    - Issues of software compatibility
    - Language differences
    - Time zone differences
    - Workforce cultural differences

### SaaS

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.1.4 Compare the implementation of systems using a client’s hardware with hosting systems remotely

- SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) (on-demand/hosted/web-based software)
- A **third-party provider** hosts applications and makes them available to customers **over the Internet**
- No traditional software **installation, maintenance, and management** approaches
- Service provider partners shoulder the burdens of **security, availability, and performance**
- e.g. Microsoft Office 365, Google Workspace, Amazon Web Services, Dropbox
- Benefits
    - **Minimize** IT responsibilities and costs
    - Well suited for **small businesses**: instead of investing in additional in-house server capacity and software licenses, companies simply can adjust their SaaS **subscription** monthly
    - Reduction in **staff workload**: in-house IT workers **liberated** from tasks associated with on-premise hardware and software
    - Better **disaster recovery**: infrastructure managed by SaaS provider
- Drawbacks
    - Multiple SaaS applications may lead to **integration** issues
    - Security: **sensitive data** stored on third-party servers
    - Government compliance regulations: storing **customer data** in a remote region

### Installation strategies

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.1.5 Evaluate alternative installation processes

- Direct changeover: stop the old system and start the new system
    - Minimal time and effort: the new system is available immediately
    - No fallback
- Parallel running: start the new system but keep the old system running
    - The old system runs a backup in case the new system fails (no loss of productivity); outputs from the two systems can be compared to see if the new one is running correctly
    - Data has to be entered twice; costly in terms of time and money
- Pilot running: the new system is piloted (tested) with a small subset of the organisation, then rolled out to the rest
    - All features are fully trialed; if the new system fails, only a small part of the organisation suffers; staff who were part of the pilot can train other staff
    - No fallback for the pilot group
- Phased conversion: introduced in phases (gradually replaced with the new system)
    - Allows people to get used to the new system; training of staff
can be done in stages
    - No fallback if a phase fails

### Data migration

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.1.6 Discuss problems that may arise as a part of data migration

- Data migration = moving data (e.g. copy data onto USB drive, moving database from one server to another)
- Problems with data migration
    - Incompatible file formats: the data created in one version of the program might not be **compatible with another version**
    - **Data structure** differences: e.g. moving data from a table to a flat file, or from an array to a linked list
    - Validation rules: data will be **rejected** if the validation rules are different
    - Incomplete data transfers: if the transfer is **interrupted**, the data might be **corrupted**
    - International conventions on dates, currencies and character sets: e.g. DD/MM/YYYY vs MM/DD/YYYY, £ vs $, ASCII vs Unicode

### Testing

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.1.7 Suggest various types of testing

See [SL02b](02b.md#planning-system-installation).

## User Focus

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.1.8 Describe the importance of user documentation
    - 1.1.9 Evaluate different methods of providing user documentation
    - 1.1.10 Evaluate different methods of delivering user training

See [SL03a](03a.md).

## System Backup

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.1.11 Identify a range of causes of data loss
    - 1.1.12 Outline the consequences of data loss in a specified situation
    - 1.1.13 Describe a range of methods that can be used to prevent data loss

- Causes of data loss
    - Hardware/system malfunctions
    - Human error (e.g. accidental deletion, overwriting, formatting the drive, dropping the device physically)
    - Software corruption
    - Malicious software (e.g. viruses, ransomware)
    - Internal breaches (e.g. disgruntled employees)
- Aspects to consider for consequences of data loss
    - Can the data be replaced?
    - How easy is the data to replace?
    - Who will be affected by the data loss?
    - Are there financial implications to the data loss?
    - Are the "life-and-death" consequences of the loss?
    - Who is responsible for data recovery?
- Methods to prevent data loss
    - Failover system: the constant capability to automatically and seamlessly switch to a highly reliable **backup system**
    - Redundancy: the same piece of data is held in **two separate places**
    - Removable media (e.g. CD, DVD, USB drive)
    - Offsite/online storage: data is stored in a **different location** external to the core system (for cloud storage: done remotely over the Internet)

## Software Deployment

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.1.14 Describe strategies for managing releases and updates

- Release: **launching** a new product for a specific market or user base
- Update: a software file that contains **fixes** for problems
- Patch: a software update **inserted (patched)** into an executable program (often temporary fixes between full releases)
- Ways to get updates
    - Manually: downloaded and installed by the user
        - Full control over when to update, but time-consuming
    - Automatically: software automatically contacts the developer to download and install any updates
        - Always up-to-date, but a bad update might crash the system
- Release management strategies
    - Continuous delivery: teams produce software in **short cycles**
        - Building, testing, and releasing software with greater **speed and frequency**
        - Reduces the **cost, time, and risk** of delivering changes by allowing for more **incremental updates** to applications in production
    - Agile software development: requirements and solutions **evolve** through the **collaborative effort** of **self-organizing** and **cross-functional** teams and their customers/end users
        - Advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement
        - Encourages rapid and flexible response to change
    - DevOps: unifying software development (Dev) and software operation (Ops)
        - Advocates automation and monitoring at all steps of software construction
