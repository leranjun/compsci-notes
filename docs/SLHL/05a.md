## Searching algorithms

Principles of searching algorithms:

- Compare the search term with a particular element
- Return found or keep searching until nothing is left to search

### Linear search

- Pre-condition: none
- Post-condition: returns the index position found or -1
- Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$

Method:

- Start from the beginning of the array
- Compare the search term with the current element
- If the search term is found, return the index position
- Otherwise, move to the next element
- Keep going until the end of the array
- Return -1 if the search term is not found

```pseudo
SUB FUNCTION linearSearch(arr, tar)
    FOR i <- 0 TO arr.length - 1 DO
        IF arr[i] = tar THEN
            // Found
            RETURN i
        ENDIF
    NEXT

    // Not found
    RETURN -1
ENDSUB
```

### Binary search

- Pre-condition: array sorted
- Post-condition: returns the index position found or -1
- Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$

Method:

- Use `low`, `high` and `mid` to keep track of the search range
- Start from the middle of the array (if even number of elements, round up)
- If the search term is found, return the index position
- Otherwise, discard the half of the array that the search term cannot be in by updating `low`, `high` and `mid`
- Keep checking from `mid` until the search term is found or the search range is exhausted
- Return -1 if the search term is not found

```pseudo
SUB FUNCTION binarySearch(arr, tar)
    low <- 0
    high <- arr.length - 1

    WHILE low <= high DO
        mid <- (low + high) / 2

        IF arr[mid] = tar THEN
            // Found
            RETURN mid
        ELSE IF arr[mid] < tar THEN
            // Move to the right
            low <- mid + 1
        ELSE
            // Move to the left
            high <- mid - 1
        ENDIF
    ENDWHILE

    // Not found
    RETURN -1
ENDSUB
```

## Sorting algorithms

Principles of sorting algorithms:

- Compare one element in the array to another
- Decide whether a swap is needed
- Keep going until no more swapping is needed

### Bubble sort

- Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$

Method:

- Start from the beginning of the array
- Compare the current element with the next element
- If the current element is larger than the next element, swap them
- Otherwise, move to the next element
- Keep going until the end of the array
- Repeat the process until no more swapping is needed

#### Optimisations

- Decreasing range: the last `r` elements are already sorted (where `r` is the number of passes)
- Early termination: if no swapping is needed in a pass, the array is sorted

```pseudo hl_lines="17 18 21 22"
/* Naive implementation */
FOR i <- 0 TO n - 1 DO
    FOR j <- 0 TO n - 2 DO
        IF a[j] > a[j + 1] THEN
            // Swap
            temp <- a[j]
            a[j] <- a[j + 1]
            a[j + 1] <- temp
        ENDIF
    NEXT
NEXT

/* Optimised implementation */
swapped <- true
pass <- 0

// Early termination
WHILE swapped DO
    swapped <- false

    // Decreasing range (pass is the # of elements already sorted)
    FOR i <- 0 TO n - 2 - pass DO
        IF a[i] > a[i + 1] THEN
            // Swap
            temp <- a[i]
            a[i] <- a[i + 1]
            a[i + 1] <- temp
            swapped <- true
        ENDIF
    NEXT

    pass <- pass + 1
ENDWHILE
```

### Selection sort

- Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$

Method:

- Start from the beginning of the array
- Find the smallest element in the array
- Swap the smallest element with the current element
- Move to the next element
- Keep going until the end of the array

```pseudo
FOR i <- 0 TO n - 1 DO
    mnmP <- i

    FOR j <- i + 1 TO n - 1 DO
        IF a[j] < a[mnmP] THEN
            // Update minimum position
            mnmP <- j
        ENDIF
    NEXT

    // Swap
    temp <- a[i]
    a[i] <- a[mnmP]
    a[mnmP] <- temp
NEXT
```
