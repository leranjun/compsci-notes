## Searching algorithms

Principles of searching algorithms:

- Compare the search term with a particular element
- Return found or keep searching until nothing is left to search

### Linear search

- Pre-condition: none
- Post-condition: returns the index position found or -1
- Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n)$

Method:

- Start from the beginning of the array
- Compare the search term with the current element
- If the search term is found, return the index position
- Otherwise, move to the next element
- Keep going until the end of the array
- Return -1 if the search term is not found

```java
int linearSearch(int[] array, int searchTerm) {
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {
        if (array[i] == searchTerm) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

### Binary search

- Pre-condition: array sorted
- Post-condition: returns the index position found or -1
- Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$

Method:

- Use `low`, `high` and `mid` to keep track of the search range
- Start from the middle of the array (if even number of elements, round up)
- If the search term is found, return the index position
- Otherwise, discard the half of the array that the search term cannot be in by updating `low`, `high` and `mid`
- Keep checking from `mid` until the search term is found or the search range is exhausted
- Return -1 if the search term is not found

## Sorting algorithms

Principles of sorting algorithms:

- Compare one element in the array to another
- Decide whether a swap is needed
- Keep going until no more swapping is needed

### Bubble sort

- Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$

Method:

- Start from the beginning of the array
- Compare the current element with the next element
- If the current element is larger than the next element, swap them
- Otherwise, move to the next element
- Keep going until the end of the array
- Repeat the process until no more swapping is needed

#### Optimisations

- Early termination: if no swapping is needed in a pass, the array is sorted
-

### Selection sort

- Time complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$

Method:

- Start from the beginning of the array
- Find the smallest element in the array
- Swap the smallest element with the current element
- Move to the next element
- Keep going until the end of the array
