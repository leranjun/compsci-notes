Steps to design a new system:

1. Determine stakeholders
2. Obtain requirements
3. Gather information for the new system
4. Start designing/building the new system

### Stakeholders

A stakeholder is a person, group or organisation that **has an interest or concern** in an organisation (e.g. creditors, directors,
employees, government agencies, owners/shareholders, suppliers, unions, and the community from which the business draws its resources).

**Not all stakeholders are equal** (e.g. customers v.s. employees).

![Internal v.s. external stakeholders](https://i.imgur.com/pZuD3Ry.png)

Key questions:

- Who will be affected by the new system?
- Who will the new system affect?
- Who will the end users be?
- What are their needs?

!!! warning "Note"
    Stakeholders may not necessarily be the end users of the system.

Principle of utilitarianism: the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

### Obtaining requirements

Methods of obtaining requirements:

- Direct observation
- Interviews
- Surveys
- Collecting documents

#### Direct observation

Direct observation is the process of **watching people** as they perform their tasks.

- Advantages
    - Possibility of gathering first-hand, unbiased information
- Disadvantages
    - People may work differently when being observed (Hawthorne effect)

#### Interviews

Interviews are **face-to-face conversations** that focus on obtaining reliable and valid data in the form of verbal responses from a person or a group of stakeholders.

They can be **structured** (pre-planned, the same set of questions to each stakeholder) or **unstructured** (flexible, encouraging stakeholders to freely express their thoughts and personal beliefs).

- Advantages
    - Allows a lot of very **detailed information** to be gathered
    - Questions can be asked to **clarify** information
    - **Non-verbal communication can be** observed
- Disadvantages
    - **Time-consuming**
    - Yields data that is difficult to **summarise, evaluate and analyse**

#### Surveys

Surveys involve handing out **questionnaires** to respondents. They should be carefully constructed to elicit **unambiguous responses**.

They can be **closed/restricted**, where the respondent is given a list of possible answers to choose from (yes/no, box-checking), or **open/unrestricted**, which involve free response questions. The former is easier to analyse, but the latter can provide more detailed information.

- Advantages
    - A **large amount of data** from a large group can be gathered
    - Guarantees **uniformality**
    - Easier to **analyse** (if closed)
    - **Time-saving**
- Disadvantages
    - Questions may suggest **misleading/biased answer**
    - **Response rate** and **quality of responses** are not guaranteed
    - Respondents may **misinterpret** questions

#### Collecting documents

Collecting documents is the process of **looking into existing documents** (e.g. user manuals, specifications, etc.) to find out how the current system works.

- Advantages
    - Detailed information about the present system can be gathered
    - It can be seen where the old system has problems
- Disadvantages
    - Time-consuming
    - Just looking at the forms/outputs may be confusing

### Understanding the situation

- Examining current systems
    - Who does what?
    - How do they do that? (hardware, software, network, peripherals, human resources)
- Looking for competing products
    - Identify **"gaps" in the market**
    - Informing decisions around **design choices**, pricing and marketing strategies
    - Provide insights into **customer preferences and expectations**.

!!! warning "Intellectual property"
    You own intellectual property if you:

    - created it (and it meets the requirements for copyright, a patent or a design)
    - bought intellectual property rights from the creator or a previous owner
    - have a brand that could be a trade mark, e.g. a well-known product name

- Organisational abilities
    - Can the client afford a new system/new equipment?
    - Can the staff use the new system? Is training needed?
    - Can the client have any 'downtime' to upgrade?
- Literature search
    - The process of **searching** for information in books, journals, magazines, newspapers, etc.

### Types of illustrations

- System flow chart
- Data flow diagram
- Structure chart

![System flow chart](https://i.imgur.com/7f3bDXx.png)

A flow chart is a diagram that shows the **sequence of steps** in a process using different symbols linked with arrows.

![Data flow diagram](https://i.imgur.com/gI3AZi4.png)

A data flow diagram maps out the **flow of information** for
any process or system. It uses symbols, such as rectangles, circles and arrows, with text labels to show data inputs, outputs, storage points and the route that data takes through the system.

![Structure chart](https://i.imgur.com/IsTz1EO.png)

A structure chart represents the organisation of a system, showing the parts in **hierarchical order**.

Other types of diagrams include [UML](04.md#unified-modeling-language-uml) and wireframes.

### Prototype

Prototypes are **abstract representations** of a system that often focuses on only one or two key aspects. They are important in testing and illustrating the proposed system to the client.

Purposes of prototypes:

- Fail early and inexpensively
    - Quickly weed out the approaches that don't work to focus on the ones that do
- Gather more accurate requirements
    - Interviews and focus groups can fall short because many people find it difficult to **conceptualise** a product before they see it
    - Prototypes can demonstrate the functionality to help solidify requirements for the final design
- Technically understand the problem
    - Prototype address both the foreseen and the unforeseen technical challenges of a device's design
- Resolve conflicts
- Rally financial support
- File patents

![Process of prototyping](https://i.imgur.com/uVPGyLQ.png)

### Iteration

Iteration is the process of **repeating a process** to improve it.

![IB MYP Design cycle](https://i.imgur.com/1iNP84K.png)

### End-user involvement

Not involving the end user in the design process can lead to:

- Unsatisfactory results
- Unsuitable solutions for the user's problem, affecting the user's productivity

## Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.2.12 Define the term usability

### Ergonomics

Ergonomics is the scientific discipline that studies the **interaction between humans and other elements of a system** to optimize human well-being and overall system performance (how well the form fits the function).

### Accessibility

Accessibility is the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people who **experience disabilities**. This includes specialist peripherals and software such as:

- Braille keyboards
- Eye-typers
- Accessible controllers
- Screen readers
- Voice synthesizers

### Usability

Usability is the **ease of use** and **learnability** of a product, system or service. It consists of both ergonomics and accessibility.

![System acceptability breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/tPu6buQ.png)

Components of usability include:

- **Learnability**: how easy is it to learn how to use the system?
- **Efficiency**: how quickly can the system be used?
- **Memorability**: how easy is it to remember how to use the system?
- **Errors**: what is the rate of user errors when using the system?
- **Satisfaction**: how satisfied are users with the system?

### Utility

**Utility** refers to how well the design's functionality meets the user's needs.

A useful product fulfils both **usability** and **utility**. It is not useful if it is easy to use but does not meet the user's needs, nor is it useful if it meets the user's needs but is difficult to use.

## Planning & System Installation

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.1.7 Suggest various types of testing

Testing is important because it can identify **errors** and **defects** in the system. It is also a way to **evaluate** the system.

A system that does not work as expected can reduce **productivity** and **end-user satisfaction**.

### Components of software testing

- Functionality testing
- User experience testing
- Performance and load testing
- Compatibility testing
- Security testing
- Test management and automation

### Types of test data

- **Normal data**: data that is **expected** to be entered into the system (should be **accepted**)
- **Boundary data**: data that is on the **edge** of the range of values that the system is designed to handle (should be **accepted**)
- **Abnormal data**: data that is **not expected** to be entered into the system, such as data outside a range or of an incorrect type (should be **rejected**)

### Debugging

Debugging is the process of **finding and removing errors** from a program.

### Automated testing

Automated testing is the process of **automating the testing process** to reduce the time and effort required to test a system. It makes use of tools that control the execution of test cases and compare the results with the expected results.

### Dry-run testing

Dry-run testing is the process of **simulating the actual use of a system** to test its functionality and performance, conducted using pen and paper or a prototype.

### Static and dynamic testing

Static testing is the process of **examining the source code** of a program to find errors **without executing it**. It is often **implicit** (e.g. code review, proofreading, linting) and involves **verification**.

Dynamic testing is the process of **executing the program** with a given set of test cases to find errors. It may begin before the program is complete to test particular components. It involves **validation**.

These together help improve **software quality**.

### Alpha and beta testing

Alpha testing is performed by testers who are usually **internal employees** at the **developer's site** before the system is **released** to the client.

Beta testing is performed by testers who are usually **external clients/end users** at the **client location** for them to give comments and suggestions.

### Black-box and white-box testing

Black-box testing is the process of testing a system from the **user's perspective**, treating it as a black box without knowing its internals. It is also known as **functional testing**. Tests are using software interfaces and ensuring they work as expected.

White-box testing is the process of testing a system from the **developer's perspective**, using the knowledge of its workings. It is also known as **structural testing**.

![Black-box vs white-box testing](https://i.imgur.com/5soz0Hs.png)

### Unit and integration testing

Unit testing is the process of testing a **single component** of a system to ensure that it works as expected.

Integration testing is the process of testing the **interaction** between components of a system to ensure that they work together as expected.

### User acceptance testing

User acceptance testing is performed by the **client** to determine whether or not the system meets their requirements. This is the **final stage** of testing before the system is released to the client.

It differs from usability testing in that it tests whether the system meets the client's **requirements**, whereas usability testing tests whether the system is **functional**.
