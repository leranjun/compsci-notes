# 05b Collections vs Arrays

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 4.2.2 Outline the standard operations of collections
    - 4.2.6 Construct pseudocode to represent an algorithm
    - 4.2.7 Suggest suitable algorithms to solve a specific problem
    - 4.3.11 Construct algorithms using the access methods of a collection
    - 4.3.12 Discuss the need for sub-programmes and collections within programmed solutions
    - 4.3.13 Construct algorithms using ... collections

Collections store a set of elements of any type.

```pseudo
// STUFF is a collection that already exists
STUFF.resetNext()
    loop while STUFF.hasNext()
    ITEM = STUFF.getNext()
    // process ITEM in whatever way is needed
end loop
```

| Method name | Brief description | Example: `HOT`, a collection of temperatures | Comment |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `addItem()` | Add item | `HOT.addItem(42)`<br>`HOT.addItem("chile")` | Adds an element that contains the argument, whether it is a value, String, object, etc. |
| `getNext()` | Get the next item | `TEMP = HOT.getNext()` | `getNext()` will return the first item in the collection when it is first called. Note: `getNext()` does not remove the item from the collection. |
| `resetNext()` | Go back to the start of the collection | `HOT.resetNext()`<br>`HOT.getNext()` | Restarts the iteration through the collection. The two lines shown will retrieve the first item in the collection. |
| `hasNext()` | Test: has next item | `if HOT.hasNext() then` | Returns `TRUE` if there are one or more elements in the collection that have not been accessed by the present iteration: The next use of `getNext()` will return a valid element. |
| `isEmpty()` | Test: collection is empty | `if HOT.isEmpty() then` | Returns `TRUE` if the collection does not contain any elements. |
