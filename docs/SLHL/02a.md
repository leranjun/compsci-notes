# 02a Problem-Solving & Java (Main)

## Thinking Procedurally

### Development phases

1. Identification: identify the problem, understand the problem, formulate the problem
2. Development: explore various alternatives
3. Selection: choose the best alternative
4. Implementation: implement the selected solution

### Procedure

A subroutine that carries out a set of instructions.

<pre><code><b>Sub procedure</b> showProduct(x, y, z)
    Output "The product of", x, y, z, "is", x * y * z
End sub

<b>Call</b> showProduct(5, 10, 15)
</code></pre>

#### Benefits

!!! note
    The main benefit is to **prevent repetition**.

- Can be used *across* multiple problems, not just *within*
- Updates ripple through (only need to change one place instead of finding all the occurrences of a code snippet)
- Well-tested & reliable
- Speeds up development (no need to write out the same code every time)
- Abstraction (not concerned with implementation, just purpose)

### Function

A subroutine that carries out a set of instructions **and returns a value** to the part of the program that called it.

!!! attention
    Must **return** a value!

<!-- markdownlint-disable-->
<pre><code><b>Sub function</b> calcProduct(x, y, z)
    ans = x * y * z
    <b><u>return</u></b> ans
End sub

<b>prod</b> = <b>Call</b> calcProduct(5, 10, 15) // the return value gets stored in the variable prod
Output prod
</code></pre>
