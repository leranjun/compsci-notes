# 02a Problem-Solving & Java (Main)

## Thinking Procedurally

### Development phases

1. Identification: identify the problem, understand the problem, formulate the problem
2. Development: explore various alternatives
3. Selection: choose the best alternative
4. Implementation: implement the selected solution

### Procedure

A subroutine that carries out a set of instructions.

<pre><code><b>Sub procedure</b> showProduct(x, y, z)
    Output "The product of", x, y, z, "is", x *y* z
End sub

<b>Call</b> showProduct(5, 10, 15)
</code></pre>

#### Benefits of procedures

!!! note
    The main benefit is to **prevent repetition**.

- Can be used *across* multiple problems, not just *within*
- Updates ripple through (only need to change one place instead of finding all the occurrences of a code snippet)
- Well-tested & reliable
- Speeds up development (no need to write out the same code every time)
- Abstraction (not concerned with implementation, just purpose)

### Function

A subroutine that carries out a set of instructions **and returns a value** to the part of the program that called it.

!!! warning "Attention"
    Must **return** a value!

<pre><code><b>Sub function</b> calcProduct(x, y, z)
    ans = x *y* z
    <b><u>return</u></b> ans
End sub

<b>prod</b> = <b>Call</b> calcProduct(5, 10, 15) // the return value gets stored in the variable prod
Output prod
</code></pre>

## Thinking Logically

### Iteration

1. Counted loop: `FOR ... TO ... (STEP ...) NEXT`
2. Pre-condition loop: `WHILE ... DO ... ENDWHILE`
3. Post-condition loop: `REPEAT ... UNTIL`

### Selection

1. `IF ... THEN ... ENDIF`
2. `IF ... THEN ... ELSE ... ENDIF`
3. `IF ... THEN ... ELSE IF ... THEN ... ELSE ... ENDIF`
4. `SWITCH ... CASE ... ELSE ... ENDSWITCH`

### Boolean algebra

- `AND` (`&&`): `true` if both operands are `true`
- `OR` (`||`): `true` if either operand is `true`
- `NOT` (`!`): `true` if the operand is `false`
- `XOR` (`^`): `true` if one operand is `true` and the other is `false`
- `NAND` (`&&` then `!`): `true` if both operands are `false`
- `NOR` (`||` then `!`): `true` if both operands are `false`

## Thinking Ahead

Pre-condition and post-condition comments are useful for documenting the purpose of a subroutine.

```pseudocode
// Pre: A positive number x is passed to the function
// Post: Calculates and returns the square root of x
Sub function sqrt(x)
    ans = x ^ 0.5
    return ans
End sub
```
