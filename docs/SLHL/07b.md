## Components of a Computer System

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.2.1 Define the terms: hardware, software, peripheral, network, human resources
    - 1.2.2 Describe the roles that a computer can take in a networked world
        - Roles include client, server, email server, DNS server, router and firewall
    - 1.2.3 Discuss the social and ethical issues associated with a networked world

### 5 components of a computer system

1. Hardware: **physical parts** of a computer and related devices
    - **Internal** hardware devices (**components**): motherboard, hard drive, RAM
    - **External** hardware devices (**peripherals**): monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, scanner
2. Peripherals (I/O devices): any **external device** that provides input and output for the computer
    - **Input peripherals**: keyboard, mouse
    - **Output peripherals**: monitor, printer
3. Network: **multiple devices** that communicate with one another using a **transmission medium** (see [Topic 3](08.md))
4. Software: computer **programs** or sets of instructions
    - **Virtual**, not physical
    - Consists of **lines of code**
    - Stored as **binary**
5. Human resources: **people** who work for an organisation and the department responsible for **managing resources** related to employees (**end users**)

### Roles of a computer

![Roles of a computer](https://i.imgur.com/oAOSuND.png)

- Client: **requests** data from a server
- Server: **provides** data to a client
    - On a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN)
    - Includes types that run specific software to its purpose (e.g. web servers, email servers, DNS servers, file servers, print servers)
- Client-server model: a **centralised** system where clients request data from a server (**one-to-many** relationship with clients)
    - The server can **accept/reject** a connection request
    - If the connection is accepted, the establishes and maintains a connection with the client over a **protocol**

- Router: a hardware device that **routes** data from a local area network (LAN) to another network (e.g. the Internet)
    - Can be a separate device or software on a server
- Domain Name System (DNS) server: translates **domain names** (e.g. `google.com`) to **IP addresses** (e.g. `64.233.160.0`), which are used to access Internet resources

- Firewall: a **barrier** between a trusted system and outside connections by **filtering** incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a **blocklist** or **allowlist**
    - Can be hardware or software

## System Design & Analysis

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.2.4 Identify the relevant stakeholders when planning a new system
    - 1.2.5 Describe methods of obtaining requirements from stakeholders
    - 1.2.6 Describe appropriate techniques for gathering the information needed to arrive at a workable solution
    - 1.2.7 Construct suitable representations to illustrate system requirements
    - 1.2.8 Describe the purpose of prototypes to demonstrate the proposed system to the client
    - 1.2.9 Discuss the importance of iteration during the design process

See [SL02b](02b.md#system-design-analysis).

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.2.10 Explain the possible consequences of failing to involve the end-user in the design process
    - 1.2.11 Discuss the social and ethical issues associated with the introduction of new IT systems

See [SL02b](02b.md#end-user-involvement).

Social and ethical issues with new systems:

- Robots/AI replacing humans
- Addictive/frustrating/less efficient
- Prompting new markets
- Changing work patterns
- Software changes drive hardware changes and vice versa

## Human Interaction with the System

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 1.2.12 Define the term usability
    - 1.2.13 Identify a range of usability problems with commonly used digital devices
    - 1.2.14 Identify methods that can be used to improve the accessibility of systems
    - 1.2.15 Identify a range of usability problems that can occur in a system
    - 1.2.16 Discuss the moral, ethical, social, economic and environmental implications of the interaction between humans and machines

### Usability

See [SL02b](02b.md#human-computer-interaction-hci).

### Usability problems

- Difficult to handle/fiddly **hardware**
- Difficult to understand **software**
- Complex **user interface**
- Need to have lots of **prior knowledge**
- **Specialist support** needed to use the device
- Each device is different to other similar devices (no **standards**)

Questions to consider:

- What would happen if someone can't access the system?
- What would happen if they could only access certain parts?
- What happens if they misunderstand what the system requires as input?
- What would happen if they can't access the output?

### Accessibility
