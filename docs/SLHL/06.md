!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 2.1.1 Outline the architecture of the central processing unit (CPU) and the functions of the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and the control unit (CU) and the registers within the CPU
    - 2.1.2 Describe primary memory
    - 2.1.3 Explain the use of cache memory
    - 2.1.4 Explain the machine instruction cycle

### CPU architecture

- CPU: contains the circuitry necessary to **fetch, decode and execute** program instructions from and to main memory (RAM)
- ALU: part of the CPU that does all the **arithmetic** (+/-) and **logical**
(AND/OR) calculations; sometimes referred to as a **"core"** (e.g. dual core = 2 ALUs to process 2 calculations **simultaneously**)
- CU: handles the **loading** of new commands into the CPU and the **decoding** of these commands; directs the **data flow** and the **operation** of the ALU
- Register (CPU's own "memory"): small, very fast circuits that store **intermediate values** from calculations or instructions inside the CPU
    - MAR: connected to the **address bus**, contains the **memory address** of the **next instruction** to be fetched
    - MDR: connected to the **data bus**, holds data that will be **written to** or was **read from** RAM
    - Accumulator (out of syllabus)
- Bus: a wire that connects the CPU to **other devices**, normally **built into the motherboard**
    - Data bus (links RAM to CPU via MDR)
    - Control bus (links RAM to CPU via CU)
    - Memory bus (links RAM to CPU via MAR)

- RAM (Random Access Memory/primary memory)
    - Contains the data and instructions the computer has loaded since **starting up** and everything the user has opened/loaded
    - **Volatile** (loses its contents if power is lost)
    - Has a special link to the CPU (via **busses**)
- ROM (Read Only Memory)
    - Usually static (**read-only**) except flash upgrades
    - **Non-volatile** (does not lose its contents if power is lost)
    - Stores the BIOS (Basic Input Output System): a small program that allows the computer to find the **operating system** to "boot" the computer after power is restored

| RAM                                                  | ROM                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Volatile                                             | Non-volatile                                      |
| Contains programs and data loaded since "booting up" | Contains the BIOS                                 |
| Usually upgradeable, can be increased                | Usually part of motherboard, difficult to upgrade |

### Cache memory

A type of **small, high-speed memory** inside the CPU used to hold **frequently used data**, so that the CPU needs to access the much slower RAM **less frequently**.

### The machine instruction cycle

- "Fetch-decode-execute" cycle (FDE/machine cycle)
- Fetches the instruction from memory, decodes and executes
- Repeat from startup to shutdown

    .blue {
        color: blue;
    }
    .green {
        color: green;
    }
    .orange {
        color: orange;
    }
    .purple {
        color: purple;
    }
    .blue, .green, .orange, .purple {
        font-weight: bold;
    }
</style>

Procedure:

1. <span class="blue">PC</span> contains the <span class="green">address</span> of the next instruction to be fetched
2. <span class="green">Address</span> in <span class="blue">PC</span> copied to <span class="blue">MAR</span> via <span class="orange">address bus</span> (<span class="blue">MAR</span> points to an <span class="green">address</span>)
3. <span class="purple">Instruction</span> copied from the <span class="green">memory location</span> in <span class="blue">MAR</span> and placed in <span class="blue">MDR</span> via <span class="orange">data bus</span>
4. <span class="purple">Instruction</span> copied from <span class="blue">MDR</span> and placed in <span class="blue">CIR</span> via <span class="orange">data bus</span>
5. <span class="green">Address</span> part of instruction placed in <span class="blue">MAR</span>
6. <span class="blue">PC</span> increments
7. <span class="purple">Instruction</span> decoded in <span class="blue">CU</span>
8. <span class="purple">Instruction</span> executed in <span class="blue">ALU</span>

## Secondary Memory

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 2.1.5 Identify the need for persistent storage

We need secondary storage because:

- CPU has no permanent storage (only **registers** for temporary processing)
- RAM is **volatile** (loses contents if power is lost)
- Results/data need to be stored on a **persistent storage**

Primary --> cache["Cache (in CPU)"] & RAM
Secondary --> hdd[Hard drive] & SSD
Offline --> flash["Flash drive<br />(USB thumb drive)"] & optical["Optical<br />(CD, DVD)"] & tape[Tape drive]
```

## Operating Systems & Application Systems

!!! info "Syllabus points"
    - 2.1.6 Describe the main functions of an operating system
    - 2.1.7 Outline the use of a range of application software
    - 2.1.8 Identify common features of applications, which include:
        - toolbars,
        - menus,
        - dialogue boxes,
        - graphical user interface (GUI) components.
